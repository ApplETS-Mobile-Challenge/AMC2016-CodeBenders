# Motivation
Among all of the philanthropic initiatives that lie on the core principle of giving yourself towards a certain cause or person while expecting nothing in return, one of the most selfless acts possible by any human being is the act of donating one of their own organs to another needy individual. Along with being such a noble cause, it has incalculable tangible benefits to the progression of humanity with the means by which an enormous magnitude of lives can be spared. With the [statistics](http://www.organdonor.gov/about/data.html) rapidly showing a larger and larger amount of individuals accross all age groups in need of organ donations while the number of willing people out there offering their organs remaining stagnant, a mobile application that can spark a new surge of willing participants to donate their organs once their life reaches its eventual end. An app needed to be designed that can reach a grand audience, while providing motivational material to intice others into giving their bodies up for donation can be a source for great change in this philanthropic endeavour. And with these intentions the Code Benders ventured forth to create Organ Donator application for mobile phones that led to the birth of the *Organtor*.

# Introduction
Organator is a multi-platform developed mobile application which promotes Organ and Tissue donation. It has a donor and hospital type of account which has different a unique view with different functionalities. The application is split between two different functionalities. One is for all the gracoius donors out there in the public and the other for the various Hospitals that can take advantage of the massive list of Organ Donors the application will generate. Reaching this final idea is a product of exhaustive brainstorming and refinement among the team members to capture the delicate balance of novelty and urgent need amongst the community today.
